IoT Assignment

Name : Mehul Vani
Bu_# : B00810186

Assignment is in running state, make file has been include, All requirements mentioned in the assignment have been taken care of, and appropriate commenting has been done for better understanding.

I have refered as many examples as possible and also read the TinyOs book by Philip Levis and David Gay for this assignment and used the the similar code snippets as per examples.


Please note Motes should be placed as close as possible for successful communication. Also I am not sure about one thing that is if I add multiple motes like instead of 2 ,say 3 or 6 it works only the output comes in the right highlighted part.

Steps
syntax

Step 1: Run the cooja simulator
	ant run (before that go to the opt/cooja directory)

Step 2: Compile your program for a sensor platform. 
	make telosb (This compiles a binary)

Step 3: In the cooja simulator, Create a new simulation and name it (anything you wish)
	click on new simulation

Step 4:	once you have compiled your program it generates a .exe file
	select that .exe file as a Contiki process/ Firmware

Step 5: Add motes to the simulations
	Here 2 sky-motes are added

Step 6: click on start and you increase or decrease the distance of the network nodes, minimum the distance of the nodes better the communication.

Step 7: You can now see the output, bring the motes closer for better communication
